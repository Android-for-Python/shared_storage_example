# shared_storage_example

*Basic Android shared storage usage*

[Android Shared Storage Overview](https://github.com/Android-for-Python/Android-for-Python-Users#shared-storage).  

The example is the unit test for the [androidstorage4kivy](https://github.com/Android-for-Python/androidstorage4kivy/blob/main/README.md) package, as such it is probably more useful to read than to run. It includes examples of copying to and from shared storage, deleting from shared storage, and using the Android Chooser.

There are two other examples [share_send_example](https://github.com/Android-for-Python/share_send_example) and [share_receive_example](https://github.com/Android-for-Python/share_receive_example).
